# intellij_config
IntelliJ settings that mimic my atom setup


I have a few personal preferences for IntelliJ around keymaps and window settings that more closely resemble the hotkey 
abilities of atom, my editor of choice.

## Keymap 
```
new line below        cmd-enter
multi-select          cmd-d
duplicate line        cmd-shift-d
etc...
```
